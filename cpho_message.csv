2017,"Without being aware of it, our neighbourhoods and how they are built influence how healthy we are.

I chose designing healthy living as the topic for my first report as Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer because of the tremendous potential that changing our built environment has for helping Canadians live healthier lives.

Chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death in Canada. It is alarming that in 2011, almost 2.7 million or 1 in 10 Canadians 20 years and older were living with diabetes. Rising rates of type II diabetes can be considered a red flag for poor health as they are associated with higher rates of other diseases and conditions and linked to an unhealthy diet, low physical activity and higher rates of overweight and obesity. Rates of type II diabetes and other chronic diseases in Canada could be reduced by seamlessly integrating healthy living into our daily lives which can be achieved, in part, by designing and redesigning our communities.

Improving public health and preventing disease through changes to our environment is a well-founded concept. For example, infectious disease rates in the last century were reduced not just through scientific innovation and vaccination, but also through infrastructure planning by improving sanitation and addressing overcrowding in residential neighbourhoods.

This report answers many questions but also raises several others. We need better information if we are to measure the health impacts of community design to incorporate evidence-based strategies into community planning. This report will raise awareness among Canadians about the unique aspects of their communities that they could take advantage of to improve their health. It will also encourage more dialogue across the many disciplines involved in community planning and health promotion so that neighbourhood design considers and promotes physical activity, healthy diets and mental wellness."
2018,"I am pleased to present my annual report, which is a snapshot of the health of Canadians and a spotlight on the prevention of problematic substance use among youth. 

This year I am introducing a new dashboard of health indicators to provide an overall picture of the health status of Canadians. In reviewing the dashboard, it is evident that Canada continues to be a healthy nation. We are generally living long lives and rank among the top or middle third for most indicators when compared to other high income countries.

I do remain concerned, however, about the influence of persistent health inequalities and the impact of social and economic factors as barriers to living well and to the elimination of key infectious diseases.

Major chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes continue to be the leading causes of all deaths in Canada. It is important that as we age, we live in good health. Many chronic diseases can be prevented or delayed by approaches that get to the root causes of risks such as tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, and harmful use of alcohol. At the same time, mental health impacts every aspect of our lives, including relationships, education, work, and community involvement. Although the majority of Canadians report positive mental health, a third of us will be affected by a mental illness during our lifetime.

There are also worrying trends in relation to some infectious diseases. We are seeing a rise in sexually transmitted infections, while antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a global threat to our ability to cure infections. Lastly, as I highlighted in my previous report, tuberculosis is having a serious and ongoing impact on some First Nations and Inuit communities. Many cases of infectious diseases can be prevented or eliminated by reducing risks of exposure and ensuring access to screening and treatment – provided that partners also tackle underlying social factors by improving living conditions and confronting stigma.

To address key public health issues, I set out my vision and areas of focus for achieving optimal health for all Canadians earlier this year. I will champion the reduction of health disparities in key populations in collaboration with many partners and sectors. I will focus efforts in the areas of tuberculosis, AMR, built environments, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, children and youth, and the prevention of problematic substance use. 

This brings me to this year's focus on preventing problematic substance use. The growing number of opioid-related overdoses and the over 8000 deaths since 2016 are tragic and unacceptable. The national life expectancy of Canadians may actually be decreasing for the first time in decades, because of the opioid overdose crisis. At the same time, because of its social acceptance, we have lost sight of the fact that continued high rates of problematic alcohol consumption are leading to a wide-range of harms. In fact, 25% of youth in grades 7 to 12 use alcohol excessively. I am also aware that the change in legal status of cannabis means we need to make sure that youth understand that legal does not mean safe.  

We have to think about how to reverse these trends for future generations. That is why this report centres on youth and explores the reasons for harmful substance use, as well as effective approaches to prevent problematic use. 

There is a complex interplay of factors that may lead youth to use substances. We know that the marketing, advertising, and availability of a substance can increase substance use in youth. We also know that youth are more likely to use substances as a coping mechanism when they have experienced abuse and other forms of trauma. But we also know that there are protective factors that can help build youth resilience, such as stable environments and positive family and caregiver relationships.

The interconnected nature of these factors means there is a critical need to collaborate across many sectors to develop comprehensive prevention solutions. The next generation of interventions can connect sectors such as housing, social services, education, public health and primary health care, at multiple levels to implement coordinated policies, public and professional education and programs. We can also work together with the media and private sector to promote new social norms around lower risk use of substances.

Our efforts need to value the experiences and voices of youth and those who use substances. The media, health care, and social service organizations can help to eliminate stigma and discrimination by adopting equitable and compassionate policies, practices and language.

There will never be just one answer to this ever-shifting issue of problematic substance use. This is a key moment in Canada to examine how we address substance use across all areas of potential action: prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery. My aim with this report is to draw attention to the central role of prevention. As important initiatives like the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy advance, this report can help to inform these collective efforts to prevent substance use from becoming problematic.

I hope my report will stimulate discussion and lead to renewed action to achieve this goal."
2019,"By and large, we are a healthy nation. We can be proud of Canada's health and social systems that contribute to this status. From this position of strength, we have an even greater opportunity to lead the world in health status and to ensure all Canadians can achieve optimal health. This year, my annual report provides a snapshot of key public health trends and shines a light on one of the drivers of health inequities: stigma.

I am pleased to report on some important positive health trends this year like the lower incidence of certain chronic and other non-infectious diseases. Some social factors that lead to good health in Canada are also improving; more people are achieving post-secondary education, and poverty rates, especially childhood poverty, are decreasing.

I do continue to be concerned about worrying trends. With the dramatic rise in global measles cases this year, the risk of importation and domestic spread has increased. If we do not improve our vaccine coverage, we may lose our hard-earned measles elimination status. Sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis are also making a comeback with the additional challenge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing gonorrhoea. Youth vaping rates are increasing and we do not fully understand the related harms, from potential impacts on the respiratory system to the incidence of youth cigarette smoking. The opioid crisis continues, and claimed more than 12 deaths per day in 2018. The harms may have been much greater if a range of preventive, harm reduction, and treatment measures had not been implemented.

All of these trends are reversible. We know what to do but need to re-engineer how we implement proven public health measures in today's context. This includes getting trusted, evidence-based information to Canadians in the age of misinformation and disinformation.

Although public health policies and programs should benefit all, persistent health inequities prevent many from being able to achieve their full potential. Often these differences can only be explained by how people are treated. That is why I focused this annual report on stigma and health.

Stigma affects us all. We are all vulnerable to the slow and insidious practice of dehumanizing others and we are all responsible for recognizing and stopping it.

This is what we know. Stigma is associated with poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Stigma and discrimination towards persons with health conditions, such as mental illness, substance use disorders, and HIV, cannot be understood or treated separately from stigma related to other characteristics such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and income.

These many forms of stigma that intersect in complex ways, are very much present in our health system, driving those most in need from getting effective care and accessing services. It means that we, as health system leaders and practitioners, are contributing to negative health outcomes.

This report offers a way forward.

We can build on our Canadian multicultural and inclusive way of life, while at the same time openly recognize and name racism, homophobia, transphobia, and other stigmas related to social identities. We can stop using dehumanizing language, examine our own assumptions, and implement policies and education programs, while also measuring our progress towards stigma elimination across the health system. By understanding the common drivers, practices, and experiences of multiple stigmas, we may find more collaborative and effective interventions.

It is hard to face our vulnerabilities as individuals and organizations who set out to care for others but fall short on providing the safe, effective, and compassionate health system that puts people first. However, with a dose of humility and a deepened connection to people who experience stigma, we can deconstruct the ""us versus them"" narrative and develop the most inclusive health system in the world."
2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound impact on the health, social and economic well-being of people in Canada and around the globe. It has led to fundamental changes in our daily lives. Sadly, many Canadians have experienced its tragic consequences, including the suffering and loss of loved ones, lost jobs and livelihoods, and reduced social connections and isolation.

While the COVID-19 pandemic affects us all, the health impacts have been worse for seniors, essential workers, racialized populations, people living with disabilities and women. We need to improve the health, social and economic conditions for these populations to achieve health equity and to protect us all from the threat of COVID-19 and future pandemics.

That is why this year, the focus of my annual report is on understanding COVID-19's broader consequences and offers evidence-based solutions. The data presented in this report covers the time period from January to August 2020.

It is important that we do not lose sight of how far we have come in our efforts to understand and control this virus. Looking back to earlier this year, I am reminded of the unprecedented situation we faced. Early in the crisis, with limited data and research on the virus, governments at all levels across the country put in place broad public health measures and were successful at flattening the curve together. Canadians reached out to check on neighbours or organized grocery deliveries for those required to self-isolate after returning from abroad. Canadian industry and businesses rapidly adapted their services and retooled their manufacturing for needed equipment and supplies. These are only a few of the actions which reflect the remarkable whole-of-society effort that collectively allowed Canada to slow the epidemic over the summer months.

But our work together is not over given the low level of immunity in the population. At the time of finalizing this report, cases of COVID-19 are once again beginning to rise across the country after a period of increasing social interactions. Yet we have more knowledge now on how to reduce virus spread, more tools to detect cases, trace contacts and support isolation and quarantine. We know more about the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and are better able to manage those who are seriously ill. We know we must continue to follow public health advice and protect those at high risk while, at the same time, attending to the human, social and economic impacts our communities are experiencing. There are no easy solutions and difficult choices remain in the months ahead.

The COVID-19 pandemic has jolted our collective consciousness into recognizing that equity is vital for ensuring health security.

This means incorporating a health equity approach to pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery. It relies on leadership at all levels, commitment of all Canadians and support by a strong public health system.

The bottom line: no one is protected until everyone is protected."
2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest public health crisis that our country has confronted in a century. There is no doubt that this has tested our public health systems. And while there have been challenges, there have also been remarkable achievements, such as Indigenous ownership of the pandemic response in their communities and the rollout of the largest mass vaccination program in Canadian history. I am incredibly proud of the over 28 million Canadians 12 years of age and older who have been fully vaccinated so far. With the recent approval of Canada’s first COVID-19 pediatric vaccine formulation for children 5 to 11 years old, we will continue to see our vaccine coverage rates increase across the country.

There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be a key public health priority in Canada for the foreseeable future. At the time of publishing this report, Canada is in the midst of a fourth wave fuelled by the highly transmissible Delta variant and a new variant of concern, Omicron, has recently been identified by the World Health Organization. It is still too early to know how this new variant will impact our pandemic response in Canada but its emergence reminds us that we need to remain vigilant and adapt our response as needed moving forward. At the same time, there are other pressing public health issues that also require urgent action. These include the worsening opioid overdose crisis, increasing mental health challenges, the health impacts of climate change, and the ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance.

While our public health system has extended itself to meet the increased demands of COVID-19, it is stretched dangerously thin. The pandemic has highlighted the strengths of our system but it has also exposed long-standing cracks in the foundation. The public health system lacks the necessary resources and tools to carry out its critical work, and is the subject of “boom and bust” funding cycles that leave us ill-prepared in the face of new threats.

Moving forward, we must ensure that our public health system is better equipped to protect all people living in Canada and help them to achieve optimal health.

Simply put, we must act now to ensure that our post-pandemic future is different than our pre-pandemic past.

In my 2020 annual report, I examined the broader consequences of the pandemic, and how persisting health and social inequities have resulted in disproportional impacts of COVID-19 on some populations. The report highlighted the need for a strengthened public health system that is centred on health equity and working towards good health and wellness for all.

My 2021 annual report builds on these findings. It draws from the diverse input of public health leaders, researchers, community experts, intersectoral collaborators, and First Nations, Inuit, and Métis leaders. Working from the foundational building blocks of public health systems in Canada, my report outlines strategic opportunities and key actions for achieving a transformed public health system that best protects us all against current and emerging public health challenges.

While the pandemic is not yet over, we are at a pivotal moment where we can come together to reflect on what we have learned and, collectively, define a new way forward. Joining forces across communities and sectors, we can build the public health system that we all need and expect, in pursuit of the healthy and thriving society that we all want. It is in working together that we can make sure that we get it right."
2022,"Over the past 2 and a half years, we have been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our collective response as a society, we have made tremendous progress across Canada, averting many infections and saving many lives. And while we must continue to evolve our management of COVID-19 and its longer-term impacts, we must also turn our attention to other health threats. This includes what is arguably the largest looming threat to the health of our communities and our planet: the climate crisis.

Climate change is making weather patterns more unpredictable and causing more frequent and intense extreme weather events, like heatwaves, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires. It also threatens the availability and safety of our water and food.

The changing climate is already having a measurable impact on our health, both physically and mentally. For example, it is exacerbating the spread of climate-sensitive infectious diseases and worsening chronic conditions due to heat exposure or poor air quality. And whether it is weeks of breathing wildfire smoke, or suffering through record-setting heatwaves, or being unable to reach traditional grounds to hunt for food, no one is immune to the impact of our changing climate. Not all communities are affected equally, however. Like COVID-19, some face greater risk of exposure, are less able to adapt and more vulnerable to serious health outcomes.

This is a pivotal time for public health systems to draw on the lessons learned from the pandemic, show leadership, and work collaboratively with other sectors. We must continue to bring climate considerations into public health work to prepare for, and respond to, the now inevitable health impacts. This means supporting communities to adapt to the climate risks they will face.

But we also need to put health at the centre of climate action and focus on efforts that will lead to significant and near immediate health and environmental benefits. By advocating for healthy environments like walkable neighbourhoods, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce chronic diseases, premature deaths and hospital admissions, promote positive mental well-being and reduce air pollution. By supporting more tree canopies and building retrofits, we can promote and protect health while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

It is clear, climate action is good for our health and public health systems have a critical role to play.

In last year's report, A Vision to Transform Canada's Public Health System, I raised the alarm that, without immediate attention, Canada's public health systems will not be able to respond to overlapping emergencies or carry out essential core functions that keep communities healthy and safe. Even now, as we continue to contend with COVID-19, monkeypox has emerged as a threat globally.

My 2022 Annual Report lays out a roadmap for the broader public health system in Canada to organize and mobilize around climate-health action. It provides concrete direction on how we can use our existing tools and knowledge, while also expanding them to meet new challenges that will come along with a changing climate.

Climate change will truly test our readiness on all fronts. Our actions now will determine the magnitude of future impacts, how quickly they occur, and the extent to which our communities and future generations are able to recover and thrive.

First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples have long recognized the interconnected nature of human, animal, and environmental health. This knowledge has been central to Indigenous identity, resilience, and survival and is essential to a healthy and sustainable future for us all. It is time to embrace Indigenous ways of looking at our place in the natural world. We are not separate from our environment. To be healthy, our air, water, land, and ecosystems must also be healthy.

What lies ahead is no small task. But we know climate action works. We have the tools to understand climate change and figure out how to address this complex and growing challenge to our collective health. By acting together now, we have hope."
2023,"In recent years, our communities have faced monumental challenges, from the scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic to more frequent extreme weather events driven by climate change.

Emergencies are increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives, both here in Canada and around the world. In the past year alone, we have witnessed record heat waves, devastating floods, and an unprecedented wildfire season that has affected the air we breathe and forced the evacuation of thousands of people in communities across the country.

These events can have profound impacts on our physical and mental health, as well as on the well-being of our communities. In some cases, recovery from one emergency may not even be possible before another one hits. Emergency response is becoming more complex and more challenging.

In this report, I explore how public health can work with communities and partners across sectors to build healthier and more resilient communities. When communities are more resilient, we are better equipped to prevent, withstand, and recover from emergencies. Just as strengthening our physical infrastructure is important for emergency preparedness, such as reinforcing power grids, we must also invest in our social infrastructure to ensure strong community supports are in place for times of crisis.

Some communities are disproportionately affected by emergencies
The impacts of emergencies are not the same for everyone. Some populations are at greater risk of exposure and poor health outcomes because of pre-existing social, economic, environmental, or health inequities, including those related to racism, discrimination, and colonization. For example, people experiencing homelessness, populations that are racialized, and people living with mental health conditions or substance use disorders experienced more negative health impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, with worse outcomes for those facing multiple and overlapping barriers to good health.

Likewise, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities have been disproportionately affected by climate-related emergencies, such as wildfires and floods. These events do not just damage property, they destroy homes, livelihoods, and shared community spaces and culture that are an integral part of community resilience and are key determinants of health.

I am calling for us to reflect on and reset how we think about emergencies. We need to look beyond the immediate response and work on the foundational conditions that keep our communities healthy and strong.

Health promotion can strengthen emergency management
A growing focus on community resilience is already part of emergency management efforts. Public health has an important role to play and can bring existing tools to support this work.

Health promotion, an essential public health function, provides ways to work with communities and partners to advance health equity, strengthen social supports, and build trusted relationships that can foster social cohesion. These are all essential for an effective response to emergencies as well as other public health crises, such as the current toxic drug crisis. Health promotion can also support partnerships with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis leadership and Indigenous-led approaches, while honouring our commitments to broader reconciliation efforts.

The COVID-19 pandemic showed us that we have to do better. We saw the inequitable impacts. We listened and learned about the barriers faced by communities and how we can effectively address them. We achieved more when we worked across sectors to bring our collective expertise and tools to the table and supported trusted community organizations to reach diverse populations.

Now is the time to apply these lessons to emergency management. We can do this by integrating health promotion into emergency management plans and ensuring that communities are prioritized in all aspects of the planning cycle, from prevention to recovery. We must also put equity at the core of emergency management science, evidence, and technology.

If we take these steps, Canada can be at the forefront of international health promotion efforts. Fifty years ago, the Lalonde Report helped to spur a paradigm shift in how we think about health in Canada, beyond just health care and treatments, to include the social and economic conditions in which we live, work, and play. We have to move forward with this legacy if we want to succeed in building a stronger and more equitable society that prioritizes safety and well-being before, during, and after emergencies."
2024,"This year, the global community celebrates 50 years of progress since the launch of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (now called the Essential Programme on Immunization). Through this massive collective effort between governments, scientists, health workers, and communities, an estimated 154 million lives have been saved worldwide as a result of vaccines. Similarly, in Canada, we have much to celebrate – the successful implementation of routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to reduce cervical cancer; the rapid mobilization of resources to support mpox vaccination for those who needed it in 2022; and, the largest vaccination campaign in Canadian history in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these would have been possible without communities leading the way as part of strong and sustained collaboration.

As Canada looks towards renewing the National Immunization Strategy in 2025, vaccines will continue to be integral to disease prevention across the entire life course. They help people live longer and healthier lives, reduce school interruptions, support safer work and travel, and sustain independence for older adults. Some vaccines also work to protect whole communities through reducing the spread of infectious diseases. By preventing people from getting sick and minimizing serious health outcomes, vaccination decreases healthcare costs and increases economic productivity.

In the coming years, scientific and technological breakthroughs will lead to the introduction of a number of new vaccines that have the potential to address an expanding range of health threats, such as certain cancers and antimicrobial resistance. Novel delivery methods, like nasal vaccines and microneedle patches, hold promise for improving the vaccination experience, enhancing the acceptability and accessibility of vaccines. Reducing obstacles in accessing vaccines is particularly important for populations experiencing health inequities, such as people living with low income, individuals residing in rural and remote areas, or those facing other social or structural barriers. Many new technologies and vaccines will continue to broaden the benefits of vaccination beyond childhood and across all stages of life.

The unprecedented spotlight on public health coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic provides an important opportunity to reflect on lessons learned and envision how we can continue to foster a stronger and more resilient vaccination system that adapts to population needs. This includes ongoing work to focus on health equity, and prioritize those most at risk, as well as expand health information systems to assess threats and monitor population health. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the importance of accurate and timely information that people can trust. We must continue efforts that build resilience to mis- and disinformation before crises occur and ensure people can make informed decisions about their health.

We must strive for a vision in which everyone in Canada can experience the benefits of vaccination for health and well-being across their lives.

To achieve this vision, continued work is needed to build a public health system that can better facilitate effective collaboration, reduce health inequities by improving access to vaccines, and adapt to future challenges and opportunities. The public health system also has a responsibility to integrate rights-based approaches to uphold the rights of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples in Canada. Protecting these rights and supporting self-determination is fundamental to the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples.

Public health can provide leadership in evidence-informed vaccination planning. We have to consider how to evaluate the often high financial costs of introducing and delivering multiple new vaccines against the health and economic benefits for society. In doing so, we must construct a forward-looking approach that strengthens our current vaccination efforts, plans for future population health needs, and enhances preparedness for pandemics and other public health emergencies.

This year's report builds on my 2021 report, A Vision to Transform Canada's Public Health System, and details how we can strengthen the fundamental components, or building blocks, of the public health system to maximize the value provided by vaccines now and into the future. It proposes tangible actions to guide sustainable investments, strengthen evidence systems, and expand collaboration related to vaccination.

While this report is focused on the vaccination system within Canada, we cannot forget the important role Canada also plays as part of global responses to vaccine-preventable diseases and future pandemics. The world needs Canada to do its part to support sustainable and equitable access to priority vaccines for all."
