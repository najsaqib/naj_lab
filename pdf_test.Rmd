## Info on R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Import some data to visualize

To start, let's import international data on COVID-19 from PHAC's website and focus on G7 countries at the end of 2020  

```{r, message = FALSE}
raw_df <- read_csv("https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/international/InternationalCovid19Cases.csv")


df <- raw_df %>% 
        filter(iso_code %in% c("CAN","USA","DEU","FRA", "GBR", "ITA", "JPN")) %>%
        filter(date == "2020-12-31") %>%
        select(iso_code, date, new_cases_14_days_100k)

df
        

```

## Generate basic plot

In `ggplot` it is easy to generate a visualization with minimal one line of code. Let's look at how the G7 nations were doing at the end of 2020 with respect to new cases of COVID-19 in the past 14 days per 100,000 population 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(df, aes(x = iso_code, y = new_cases_14_days_100k)) + geom_col()

g
```
