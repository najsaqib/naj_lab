Although the app itself was easy to use, I saved zero time when I arrived at YVR as I had to line up and wait with everybody else to see one of the 2 CBSA agents available. I didn't see any benefit to using it, so not sure I'll use it again."

Took 2, 4, 4, and 13 tries (gave up on the last user entry after trying manually, scanning, and adding midway through the declaration process). If other people are experiencing the same issues with adding their profiles, this should be a priority to fix in the app."

I'm on a modern android: pixel 6 pro. what a total waste of 59.5 million."
