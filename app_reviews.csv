97655,"Worked well to submit my declaration ahead of departure from abroad to return home to Canada. Issue: If using the app with a VPN set to Canada, the app would not let me log in or create an account, with no error message at all. Easted a bunch of time, very frustrating. So minus one star. After shutting off my VPN, it worked perfectly."
60583,"Coming from an app developer - the bugs I experienced for a multi-million dollar app is inexcusable. The bugs I experienced are as follows. Firstly, the error that you're not connected to a network comes up no matter what. Then, when you try and scan a Canadian passport, it doesn't work at all. I tried for about 5 minutes, and it didn't work. I tried a non-Canadian passport, and it worked just fine. In conclusion, to avoid frustration, just wait until you get to the canadian border."
31010,"This app was advertised on the news as a way to save time upon arrival, as you would be able to use an ""express line"". Although the app itself was easy to use, I saved zero time when I arrived at YVR as I had to line up and wait with everybody else to see one of the 2 CBSA agents available. I didn't see any benefit to using it, so not sure I'll use it again."
58805,"The app hangs upon saving traveller profiles and you cannot cancel or go back. Need to restart the app and try again. Took 2, 4, 4, and 13 tries (gave up on the last user entry after trying manually, scanning, and adding midway through the declaration process). If other people are experiencing the same issues with adding their profiles, this should be a priority to fix in the app."
40641,"terrible app. it fails even simple things. camera didn't focus properly, camera didn't read passports well, app should be able to read chips like Australia and other countries, saving a traveller hung at 12% and had to be restarted losing all travellers, even after registering all 4 I was blocked from a customs déclaration for all 4 travellers saying I had duplicate birthdates (there were none). I'm on a modern android: pixel 6 pro. what a total waste of 59.5 million."
42991,"Not working properly. I am coming in to Toronto airport but the app keeps defaulting to Vancouver airport. I installed and reinstalled a few times but same problem. I type in Toronto airport, Pearson, then click on next and nothing happens. I have an Android phone and it has more than enough room for the app."

You may not have data or wifi upon arrival in the Customs hall to sign back in. I don't see an issue why you can't stay signed in. Frustrating, stopped using it, went back to my Nexus. Faster"
55719,Easy to use but I had to scan my passport 3-4 times because it was getting stuck at 12 %. I had to close and reopen the app to make it work. This problem should address to have a 5 star review.
52083,pretty easy to use but could not scan my passport details so had to enter manually. not sure why as airline app was able to scan without problems moments before.
46355,When scanning in traveller info it freezes at 12% saved several times. Otherwise seems to work.
67124,"Slow, OCR fails constantly and doesn't refocus. Pauses at 12% Constantantly. Just a bad app."
67284,"App freeze , scan passaport is horrible, and you can't fill the form manually even you put the right information."
76035,"ArriveCan is very useful, coz you declare ahead before you even arrive in Canada, so it speeds up the process once you are there. :)"
96680,Extremely easy to complete. This is a great way to speed the process of transiting Grigg the Canadian airports.
11114,This is simple and convenient. I think completing this online saves time.
